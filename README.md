# Test task. Part 2

## Hot to use
    - python 
    - from main import Bot
    - bot = Bot()
    - bot.simulate_activity()
    
## Why there's no tests?
     Because that bot is fully randomized ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## Hot you can test it?
    Try to play a little bit with data after bot.simulate_activity()
